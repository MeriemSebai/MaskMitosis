# MaskMitosis
Our mitosis detection and instance segmentation model is based on Mask RCNN model. We use the Matterport Inc Mask-RCNN implementation. For more details see [https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN]

Requirements: Hardware: 
In our experiments, we used a Nvidia Quadro P5000 GPU with 16 GB of memory.

Requirements: Software: 
Python 3.4, TensorFlow 1.3, Keras 2.0.8 and other common packages are required.
Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
3. Run setup from the repository root directory: python3 setup.py install

The pretrained MaskMitosis12 and MaskMitosis14 models are not available in current due to COVID-19 pneumonia. We will keep updating this repo.
